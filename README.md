WorldEditSelectionVisualizer (WESV) is essentially the famous [WorldEditCUI](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2171206-172-worldeditcui/) mod in the form of a bukkit plugin, which means that players don't need to install anything on their client.

## Features

- Spawns particles around WorldEdit selections so players can see them
- No client mod required
- Supports cuboid, sphere, ellipsoid, cylinder, polygon and convex selections
- Can display the current clipboard
- Use `/wesv toggle` to toggle the visualizer
- Option to only show the selection when holding the selection item
- Configurable particle effect and view distance
- Prevent players from spawning too many particles when selecting huge regions
- Highly customizable for the performance of your server
- Great compatibility: works with 1.7.10 to 1.16.x servers, with WorldEdit 6 and 7, and with or without FastAsyncWorldEdit
